Developed a Power BI Dashboard for Shop Nest Store using M Language/DAX for end-to-end data analysis. Key results: identified $1.44M in top-selling categories and exposed a 25% delayed order rate bottleneck, driving immediate inventory and logistics optimization.
## üåü Overview
Developed a comprehensive Power BI Business Intelligence Dashboard for "Shop Nest Store" to drive strategic and operational improvements. The project transformed raw, transactional data into actionable insights, focusing on sales performance, category optimization, and order fulfillment efficiency to enable data-driven decisions on inventory, marketing, and supply chain management.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Insights
The resulting dashboard provides a 360-degree view of the business, allowing users to drill down into specific dimensions:

### 1. Revenue and Sales Performance
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Calculated and visualized core metrics, including Total Revenue and Total Number of Sales.

Seasonal Trend Analysis: Visualized revenue over time using line graphs to pinpoint peak sales periods (November/December) for optimized promotional planning.

### 2. Product Category Deep Dive
Product Category Optimization: Leveraged bar charts to showcase high-grossing lines, identifying Health & Beauty (‚âà $1.44M) and Watches & Gifts (‚âà $1.21M) as top revenue drivers, guiding focused marketing and inventory allocation.

### 3. Operational Efficiency (Order Fulfillment)
Fulfillment Efficiency Analysis: Calculated custom DAX measures ('Count of Delayed Orders') and used geographical heat maps to identify the Western Region as a major bottleneck with a 25% delay rate (orders >48 hours), initiating logistics partner review.

### 4. User Interactivity
Dynamic Filtering: Incorporated robust slicers and filters allowing stakeholders to instantly analyze data by specific dates, product categories, and geographical regions.
